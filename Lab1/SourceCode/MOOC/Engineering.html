            <p data-swiper-parallax="-40%">Computer scientists design and build software, send data over networks, store
                information in databases, solve cybersecurity problems and address challenges in wireless and handheld
                devices, robotics and computer vision. Students leave SCE with a foundation in algorithmic thinking and
                modeling. They graduate to a robust job market that will experience growth into the next decade,
                according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>

            <p data-swiper-parallax="-40%">The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) defines civil engineering as
                the profession in which a knowledge of the mathematical and physical sciences gained by study,
                experience, and practice is applied with judgment to develop ways to utilize economically the materials
                and forces of nature for the progressive well-being of humanity in creating, improving and protecting
                the environment, in providing facilities for community living, industry and transportation, and in
                providing structures for the use of humankind.” The CE program aims to prepare students with a breadth
                and depth in the technical knowledge so they can work immediately in most areas of the profession,
                including geotechnical engineering; hydraulics, hydrology and water resources; structural engineering;
                and transportation/traffic engineering.</p>

                in computers, automated factories, digital recording and entertaining systems. The products they design
                are found in robots, satellites, mobile phone systems and advanced medical tools. The rapidly changing
                profession – sparked by constant technological advances – demands that graduates have a varied

                operating systems, mobile applications, browsers, software and networking. They integrate computer
                technology and tailor it to an organization’s needs and infrastructure. Planning and managing an
                organization’s IT infrastructure requires a solid foundation in applied computing, as well as management

            <p data-swiper-parallax="-40%">The ME program is one of the broadest of the engineering disciplines, thus,
                mechanical engineers are the generalists of the engineering profession. Mechanical engineers design,
                construct, test and operate many types of mechanical, thermal and biological devices. They are involved
                in almost every industry, including aerospace, automotive, bioengineering, communications, electronics,
                energy, food processing, HVAC, manufacturing, power generation and refrigeration, as well as business,
                government and academia. The ME program aims to prepare students with a breadth and depth in technical
